prompt
string
AI Model Prompt Description
The prompt is a short text that describes the image you want to generate. It can range from simple descriptions, like "a cat", to detailed scenarios, such as "a cat with wings, playing the guitar, and wearing a hat". If no prompt is provided, the AI will generate a random image.

Adding Characters to the Prompt
You can introduce characters into the prompt using the following syntax:

@character_name: Represents the character you want to include. Example: My friend @john is a great artist.
Modifying Character Strength
To adjust the influence or "strength" of a character in the image, use the following syntax:

@character_name::strength: Specify the character’s strength by appending ::strength to their name, where strength is a numerical value. Example: My friend @john::200 is a great artist.
Higher strength values will make the character more prominent in the generated image.

​
resolution
enum<string>
default:
2k
Resolution of the image

Available options: 2k, 4k 
​
aspect_ratio
enum<string>
default:
square_1_1
Image size with the aspect ratio. The aspect ratio is the proportional relationship between an image's width and height, expressed as *_width_height (e.g., square_1_1, widescreen_16_9). It is calculated by dividing the width by the height.

If not present, the default is square_1_1.

Available options: square_1_1, classic_4_3, traditional_3_4, widescreen_16_9, social_story_9_16, smartphone_horizontal_20_9, smartphone_vertical_9_20, standard_3_2, portrait_2_3, horizontal_2_1, vertical_1_2, social_5_4, social_post_4_5 
​
realism
boolean
default:
true
Experimental feature: it tries to give an extra boost of reality to your images, a kind of "less AI look".
Works especially well with photographs but it also magically works with illustrations too.
IMPORTANT: deactivate it if you are trying to generate something that is really fantastic or a known character, otherwise it won't follow your prompt well.

​
creative_detailing
integer
default:
33
Higher values can achieve greater detail per pixel at higher resolutions at the cost of giving a somewhat more "HDR" or artificial look.
Very high values can generate quite crazy things like eyes where they shouldn't appear, etc.

Valid values range [0, 100], default 33

Required range: 0 <= x <= 100
​
engine
enum<string>
default:
automatic
Select the engine for the AI model. Available options:

automatic - default choice
Illusio - for smoother illustrations, landscapes, and nature. The softer looking one.
Sharpy - better for realistic images like photographs and for a more grainy look. It provides the sharpest and most detailed images. If you use it for illustrations it will give them more texture and a less softer look.
Sparkle - also good for realistic images. It's a middle ground between Illusio and Sharpy.
Available options: automatic, magnific_illusio, magnific_sharpy, magnific_sparkle 
​
fixed_generation
boolean
default:
false
When this option is enabled, using the same settings will consistently produce the same image.
Fixed generations are ideal for fine-tuning, as it allows for incremental changes to parameters (such as the prompt) to see subtle variations in the output.
When disabled, expect each generation to introduce a degree of randomness, leading to more diverse outcomes.

​
webhook_url
string
Webhook URL to notify the user when the task is completed

​
filter_nsfw
boolean
default:
true
When enabled, if the AI model return some nsfw image we will change it for a black image. This feature is experimental and may not be 100% accurate
